Hello, my coding bootcamp is nearing the end of unit one, and it is time to build a project for grading purposes. 

 â€¢ List of the Technologies used: JavaScript , figma CSS , HTML , jquery , visual studio code editor

â€¢ An embedded screenshot of the app



  â€¢Installation instructions

  â€¢Your User stories â€“ who are your users, what do they want and why?

    MVP Goals (minimal viable product)
        As a player, I want to be on a website that has a series of questions about a subject.
        As a player, I would like to see the question and be able to control when I see the answer
        As a player, I would like to click a button that logs when I know an answer that card gets removed from the deck, versus when I reshuffle the card into the deck so that I can memorize it more.
        As a player I would like the app to score how many cards I know, are working on, and are left in the deck
        As a player, I would like to be able to restart the flashcards fresh
        As a player I would like to flip through just the front, or just the back of a deck



    Stretch goals
        As a player, I want to be able to add my own card to a deck to study
        As a player, I want to be able to create my own deck about a subject
        As a player, I would like a victory animation when I complete my deck, so that I feel good about my victory!
        As a player who requires assistive technologies, I would like accessibility features so that I'm not left out of enjoying the game.
        As a player, I want the UI to be engaging and out of the way so that I enjoy the experience of playing the game.
        As a player, I would like to hear an audible sound when I mark a game box so that I know my selection worked.
        As a player, I would to know who created this app and be able to learn more about them or reach out

  â€¢Descriptions of any Unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome


Requirements:

Flash-Cards
Pre-load your app with some data, and let the user flip through them quickly (back or front), and use the keyboard flip the card, and to mark whether they got it right or not. Track which cards were incorrect, and re-display them until the user gets them right!

Bonus:

Track scores over time (even if the page is reloaded)
Include images on one or both sides of the flash card
Let the user add flash cards (don't need to be saved across refreshes)

ðŸ”µ Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):
Add an API to your project! If you would like to make an App that performs an API call instead of having a game function, you may send in a proposal with your idea to your squad leaders. All of the main project requirements (HTML, CSS, & JS files, daily commits, clean, working code) will still be applied. You may use any free API that you would like. Here is a good list of Free Apis https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

Project Requirements
Your app must:

Render in the browser
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
Be deployed online using Github Project pages.
Use semantic, valid markup for HTML and CSS (must pass validation without errors)
Show a good commit history with frequent commits (minimum of one commit per project day)
