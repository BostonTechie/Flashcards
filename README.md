  Hello my name is Andrew, this was project was built in as part of my General Assembly's Web development Immersive class.
  I selected flash cards for development.

## TECHNOLOGY USED

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* Figma
* Visual studio code editor

## APPROACH

I started my build by using Figma to get a sense of the look I wanted for my app and what I wanted the various buttons to perform.
I then moved onto a very basic  html and CSS to have a singe button that I could attach a function to. 
Then I moved onto game logic, and  build a deck. One function / card at a time.

## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS/STRETCH GOALS

* Have a user add a deck
* Have a user add a card



## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

* clone the repository into a local file
* open the index.html file and enjoy
* or go to  https://fullstackaccountant.github.io/Flashcards/


## MVP

* Have flashcards availble to use
* As a player, I want to be on a website that has a series of questions about a subject.
* As a player, I would like to see the question and be able to control when I see the answer
* As a player, I would like to click a button that logs when I know an answer, and have that card get removed from the deck
* I would like cards reshuffle the card into the deck so that I can memorize it more. If I don't know them.
* As a player, I would like to be able to restart the flashcards fresh
